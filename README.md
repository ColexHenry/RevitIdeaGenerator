# RevitIdeaGenerator
This is a fun program that serves Revit Architecture building/room ideas. It comes as a CLI and GUI for comfort. It's very limited in the amount of rooms and such that it can generate, but in due time and with requests I could add more advanced features. 


Eventually I'll make an EXE file to make the program more portable, but this should work for now.
